`git add` - command, tell it which files to track.
e.g., `git add .` (.) - dot is all files to add track 
    or `git add index.html` - individual file or folder that you want get to track <br>


`git commit -m "write description" -m "some description"` - `-m` stand for message, and it allows you to write the description what you have updated or edited. <br>


## commit isn't live github yet.
once you save this project and commit on terminal, but it isn't *live* on gitbut yet. <br>
`git push` - I want to push this live to remote repository where my project is hosted

`ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "email@example.com"` 
`ssh-keygen` - to create or generate the SSH keys
